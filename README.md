Hello Guys!

I'm currently studying about coding and trying to better myself each day. As my native language isn't English, it's possible that I'll make grammar mistakes, so please be pacient to me :). I'll write here mostly in English in order to better my English skills, but I will also post in my native language (Portuguese) and if necessary I can aswer some question in German.
